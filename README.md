# FSAE Conceptual Design
Formula SAE (FSAE) Conceptual Design is a software, currently in development, which will allow multi-disciplinary conceptual analysis of FSAE vehicles. Its implementation philosophy is based on the following characteristics:

- Low computational cost
- Flexibility with regard to geometry parametrization and manipulation
- Optimization based on gradients
- Use of open-source programming language

# General information
- Source code language: C
- IDE: VSCODE
- Makefile
- Compiler: GCC
- Optimization software: Esteco ModeFrontier


# Getting started
General explanation on how to compile and execute the src code (TBD)

# Examples
